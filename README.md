# Sell All The Stuff
##### A simple & quick way to sell items online in one central location

Sell All The Stuff (SATS) was born out of a need to quickly sell multiple items on Craigslist while easily updating item availability. SATS reads from local JSON and dynamically displays items via [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/). When an item is marked as sold, [Foggy](https://nbartlomiej.github.io/foggy/) will blur the item.
